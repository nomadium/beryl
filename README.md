Beryl is a Smalltalk implementation on top of JRuby.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'beryl'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install beryl

## Usage

Just run beryl with your program:

```sh
$ bundle exec bin/beryl -e "Transcript show: 'Hello'"
```

The example is that trivial because Beryl is in a pre-alpha state
and the only implemented features are: to put integers in the stack,
sums and to print strings to stdout.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console`
for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`,
and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag
for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem`
file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
